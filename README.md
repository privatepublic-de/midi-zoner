# midi-zoner

Application to play multiple MIDI devices, MIDI channels and note ranges from one MIDI input source. Includes an arpeggiator with euclidian patterns.

My main motive to start programming "midi-zoner": I wanted to interact and perform with my MIDI gear without the hassle of starting a big and bloated DAW to distribute my master keyboard to multiple destinations. And neither did I like to fiddle around with tiny 16-character LCD screens to configure mentioned master keyboard for multiple zones and channels.

This is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application. Build it with node.js/npm.
